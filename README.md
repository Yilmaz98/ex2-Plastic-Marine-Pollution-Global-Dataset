This is a global dataset of 1571 locations where surface manta tows were conducted.

Samples were divided into 4 size categories. Weights and particle counts were recoreded for each category.

more information in the pollution-report.Rmd and pollution-report.pdf files in this repo

The R script and the Rmd file deal differently with the file imports. The R script uses figshare's API and work fine, but I cound't make it work on the Rmd file.
